PREREQUISITES:

Please have OCaml Graphics installed on your machine, and X11. This should be automatically available in the VM, but may require extra steps on a Mac. Most of our group has no issues with this (and did not have to even install anything extra), but one member consistently ran into errors to the point where they could not run our project after multiple attempts to install.

Dear grader:

Welcome to Splendor! Before you play, be sure to read the rulebook here:
http://www.spacecowboys.fr/img/games/splendor/details/rules/Rules_Splendor_US.pdf

After that, follow the step-by-step instructions below:

1. Navigate to the directory containing all of the source files using a command line.

2. Type make, press enter

3. Follow the instructions on screen! Please note that the total number of players should not exceed 4, or the game will crash.

4. Play Splendor! (and try and beat the AI)

NOTE: Sometimes an error appears indicating a .byte file does not exist. If this happens, go to the directory containing the source files, and delete the stray "main.byte" file.

CONTROLS AND GAME INFO:

The gem piles are set up along the left side of the screen, the available cards in the middle, nobles to the right of that, and player info to the right of that.

The current player's player info is the one at the top of the right side of the screen.

Please note that costs are represented by colored circles for both cards and nobles. Cards (and thus discounts) players have accumulated are represented by colored squares in their player info.

Nobles will automatically be given to you if you qualify for them. You do not get to choose which noble you get in the rare instance that you qualify for more than one at the same time, as it is in regular Splendor.

TAKE THREE GEMS: Click on three gems of different colors, then click Buy.

TAKE TWO GEMS: Click on two gems of the same color, then click Buy.

BUY CARD: Click on the card you want to buy, then click Buy.

RESERVE CARD: Click on the card you want to reserve, then click Reserve. To view a reserved card later, select it from your player info on the right side of the screen (you can buy the card from here as well). To reserve a card from the top of a deck, select the deck you would like to reserve the card from.

HANDLING DISCARDS:

If you need to discard gems because you have too many, you will be prompted to do so, one gem at a time. Press the key corresponding to the gem you would like to discard:

b: blue
l: black
g: green
w: white
r: red

Noting that during this discard process, your player info will be displayed as the bottom-most player, instead of the top as normal.
